# VRT Examples

This repository provides example usages of different open-source VRT libraries and frameworks available to use.

All examples use the same base project, a locally served copy of the [React TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/) project. 

Instructions for running tests and configurations are provided in each example.

## Examples
1. [jest-image-snapshot](https://github.com/gidztech/vrt-examples/blob/master/examples/jest-image-snapshot-example/README.md)
2. [muppeteer-example](https://github.com/gidztech/vrt-examples/blob/master/examples/muppeteer-example/README.md)
